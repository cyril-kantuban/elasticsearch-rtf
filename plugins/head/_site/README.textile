h2. Installing and Running

There are two ways of running and installing elasticsearch-head

h4. Running as a plugin of ElasticSearch (this is the preferred method)

If you've installed the .deb package, then the plugin exectuable will be available at /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin.

* @sudo elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head@
* @open http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/@

This will automatically download the latest version of elasticsearch-head from github and run it as a plugin within the elasticsearch cluster. In this mode;
* elasticsearch provides a simple webserver to run head
* elasticsearch-head automatically connects to the node that is running it
* is available at "http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/":http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/ (or whatever the address of your cluster is)
* Will not work with elasticsearch prior to version 0.17

h5. URL Parameters

Parameters may be appended to the url set some initial state eg. @head/index.html?base_uri=http://node-01.example.com:9200@

* @base_uri@ force elasticsearch-head to connect to a particular node.
* @auth_user@ adds basic auth credentials to http requests ( requires "elasticsearch-http-basic":https://github.com/karussell/elasticsearch-http-basic plugin)
* @auth_password@ basic auth password as above (note: without "additional security layers":http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/988/is-basic-auth-secure-if-done-over-https, passwords are sent over the network *in the clear* )


h4. Running as a standalone webapp

* @git clone git://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head.git@
* @cd elasticsearch-head@
* @open index.html@

This will manually download the latest version of elasticsearch-head from github and run it standalone. In this mode;
* elasticsearch-head is running from the file system and some features will not work
* may have trouble connecting to the node if the node is protected by some security measures
* works with any version of elasticsearch

h4. Alternatives

elastisearch-head is a standalone webapp written in good-ol' html5. This means, you can put it up on any webserver, run it directly from the filesystem, use it on an ipad, or put it on a floppy disk and carry it with you.
